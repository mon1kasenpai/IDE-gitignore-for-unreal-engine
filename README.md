# IDE gitignore for unreal engine 5
 A custom gitignore i edit from time to time to account for all mainline IDEs i use/have used with unreal Engine similar to how the default gitignore targets VS files. I designed this for myself but if you wanna use it yourself or add some more i might have missed thats totally fine.
